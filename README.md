# Async-Server-OS

## Overview

AsyncServer is an Operating System and Networking application implemented in C that replicates key operating system functionality, including process management, multi-threading, and an interactive shell.

It includes asynchronous, event-driven networking capabilities, allowing it to operate as a server and to handle high loads of concurrent client requests.

## Implementation Details

AsyncServer is written in C and uses Linux system calls to implement inter-process communication, redirection and pipelining, signal handling, and socket (TCP/IP) programming.

## Usage/Access

This program was built as an extension of a school project, and the source code is being kept private in accordance with university policies. If you would like to know more please [contact me](mailto:jeremygleason@icloud.com) and I can walk you through the project's code.
